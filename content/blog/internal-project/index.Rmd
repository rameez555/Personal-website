This blog post will teach you how to create 2D and 3D scatter plot using an open source dataset called "iris"
```{r}
# load the required libraries
library(car)
library(psych)
library("scatterplot3d")

# load the dataset
data("iris")

# take a brief look at the dataset using head and tail functions
head(iris)
tail(iris)

# remove the species column
iris = iris[,-5]

# create the scatterplot matrix
scatterplotMatrix(iris)

# to create a scatter plot with density plots and correlation ellipses
pairs.panels(iris[,-5], 
  method = "pearson", 
  hist.col = "#00AFBB", 
  density = TRUE, 
  ellipses = TRUE) 

# to create a 3d scatter plot 
# load the dataset again
data(iris)

# choose the colours
colors <- c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9")
colors = colors[as.numeric(iris$Species)]
s3d = scatterplot3d(iris[,1:3], pch = 16, type="h", color=colors) 

# to set the legend
legend(s3d$xyz.convert(7.5, 3, 4.5),  legend = levels(iris$Species), 
col = c("#999999","#E69F00","#56B4E9"),pch=16)

# # to draw an animated 3d scatterplot
library(rgl)             
library(magick)
colors = c("royalblue1","darkcyan","oldlace")
iris$color <- colors[ as.numeric( as.factor(iris$Species) ) ]

# to create a static plot
plot3d( iris[,1], iris[,2], iris[,3], col = iris$color, type = "s", radius = .2 )

# to indicate axis and rotation velocity
play3d( spin3d( axis = c(0, 0, 1), rpm = 20), duration = 10 )  
movie3d(movie="3dAnimatedScatterplot", 
spin3d( axis = c(0, 0, 1), rpm = 7),
duration = 10, dir = "getwd()",type = "gif", 
clean = TRUE)    # to save as gif file

```
